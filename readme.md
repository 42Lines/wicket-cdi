Wicket-CDI provides integration of CDI into Wicket

## Features

#### Injection of Component subclasses
All component subclasses will have their dependencies injected upon instantiation.

#### Automatic Propagation of Long Running (Non-Transient) Conversations
Wicket-CDI supports three different conversation propagation modes:
* NONE - conversations are not propagated across requests even if conversation is marked as non-transient
* NONBOOKMARKABLE - conversations marked as non-transient are propagated page-to-page as long as page navigation is non-bookmarkable (`setResponsePage(anotherPageInstance);`). The propagation happens using page instance metadata so urls are not effected.
* ALL - conversations marked as non-transient are propagated across all requests. The conversation id is encoded in a `cid` parameter of every url generated by Wicket.

`NONBOOKMARKABLE` mode offers a compromise between an all manual solution (`NONE`) and an all out propagation (`ALL`) by giving the developer a fairly easy way to define the scope for long-running conversations.

#### CDI-Aware RequestCycleListener Extension
Wicket-CDI provides a `ICdiAwareRequestCycleListener` mixin which allows request cycle listeners to take advantage of two new events:
* onAfterConversationActivated() - called after a non-transient conversation is started or a long-running conversation is activated
* onBeforeConversationDeactivated() - called right before the current conversation is deactivated at the end of request processing

This allows request cycle listeners to implement `onBegin/EndRequest` functionality but inside an active conversational context.

#### Injection of Unmanaged (aka NonContextual) Instances
It happens often that an unmanaged instance such as a `Behavior` or `Session` needs to be injected. Wicket-CDI provides a simple API to do just that:

`CdiContainer.get().getNonContextualManager().postCreate(instance);`

Invoking this method on the `instance` will cause its injection points to be injected as well as any `@PostConstruct` methods to be invoked. There is also a symmetrical cleanup method which can be used to release any resources held by an unmanaged instance:

`CdiContainer.get().getNonContextualManager().preDestroy(instance);`

Invocation of this method will invoke any `@PreDestroy` methods as well as release all injected resources.

## Installation

Wicket-CDI depends on seam-conversation module to activate and deactivate conversational contexts, so you will need a seam-conversation module specific to your CDI container. For example, for JBoss Weld:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.seam.conversation</groupId>
        <artifactId>seam-conversation-weld</artifactId>
		<version>3.0.0.CR2</version> <!-- TODO check for latest version -->
    </dependency>

Then add the Wicket-CDI module:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.ftlines.wicket-cdi</groupId>
        <artifactId>wicket-cdi</artifactId>
		<version>1.0</version> <!-- TODO check for latest version -->
    </dependency>

## Configuration
Configuration of Wicket-CDI is done via a `CdiConfiguration` object that uses a simple fluent api:

    public class MyApplication extends WebApplication {
	    protected void init() {
            BeanManager beanManager=retrieveBeanManagerUsingCdiContainerSpecificApi();
            
			new CdiConfiguration(beanManager)
                .setPropagation(ConversationPropagation.NONBOOKMARKABLE)
                .configure(this);
	    }
    }
